    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p class="profile-description">I am a student at INHA University in Tashkent. I am a lifelong learner eager to master sciences and share what I have learned.</p>

    <h2>My Skills</h2>

    <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="python" src="images/python.png" alt="python-image">
        <h3>Python Programming</h3>
        <p>Before I started studying at university, I had no prior experience in programming.
            However, after I started learning Python, I realised the connection between programming languages and
            their similarities: the same as spoken language families. I am currently an Intermediate Python Developer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="c" src="images/c-.png" alt="c++-image">
      <h3>C++ Programming</h3>
      <p>C++ is my very first programming language.
          It is the one where I printed "Hello world" to the console for the first time.
          Its dazzling pointers, access to dynamic memory allocation and multiple inheritance features always amaze me.
          I have created over ten console-based educational apps so far.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="programming" src="images/programming.png" alt="programming-image">
      <h3>Web development</h3>
      <p>I am learning Web Development as part of my studies in Python.
          I am very interested in the principles of Front and Back End systems, so I want to become a Full Stack Developer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="languages" src="images/languages.png" alt="languages-image">
      <h3>Linguistics</h3>
      <p>I enjoy learning languages.  I can speak eight languages, and Uzbek is my native one.
          I am conversational in English, French, and Russian.
          I am currently learning Arabic, Turkish, Chinese and Italian. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="languages-earth" src="images/languages-earth.png" alt="languages-earth-image">
      <h3>Language teaching</h3>
      <p>I have plenty of experience in education as I have been teaching English professionally for two years.
          I have recently started hosting my language events as a volunteer event host on Duolingo.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="physics" src="images/atom.png" alt="atom-image">
      <h3>Physics</h3>
      <p>I am honestly into problem-solving. I have studied the principles of Physics for a couple of years,
          and I can say that understanding this science lets you perceive the world much differently.
          I can provide professional assistance in learning this subject.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="math" src="images/math.png" alt="math-image">
      <h3>Maths</h3>
      <p>My high interest in exact sciences starts from maths, of course. I have been learning miracles of this subject
          throughout my whole life. I can help school graduates prepare for their higher education exams. </p>
